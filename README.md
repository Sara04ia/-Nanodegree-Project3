## 1. Project Overview
This is a capstone project of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program of Udacity. In this project, the given dataset contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offers during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this dataset.

## 3. Installation
No extra besides the built-in libraries from Anaconda needed to run this project
Data Processing & Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sciki-Learn
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn


## 4. File Descriptions
This repo contains 4 files.There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions and wrangling process. There are 3 data files used to address the above qustions

portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json - demographic data for each customer
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
